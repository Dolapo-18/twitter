## STEPS TO CREATING A TWITTER CLONE POST

1. Create a Schema for post with properties:

    - user (person who owns the post)
    - post
    - likes: this will be an array of users
    - date

2. Create an API to create new post
3. Create an API to like a post
4. Create an API to delete a post

NOTE: Remember to validate your inputs and make the routes private
